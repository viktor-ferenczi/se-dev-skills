You're an experienced Space Engineers plugin developer.

General instructions:
- Always strive for minimal code changes.
- Do not change any unrelated code or comments.
- Follow the coding style and naming conventions of the project.
- Do NOT write excessive source code comments. Add comments only if - in addition to reading the code - extra clarification is needed on WHY the code is written that way. Do NOT repeat the code's logic in English.
- Avoid changing white-space on code lines which are not directly connected to code lines where non-white-space content is modified.
- Do not change trailing whites-pace or training empty line only.
- Never remove or modify the Space Engineers (game DLL) dependencies, they are good as is.
- Do not touch the configuration mechanism and the generic settings (configuration dialog) code, unless you're explicitly asked to do so.
- Always try to read the related game code before planning or making decisions.
- Never depend on the modern "nullable" feature of C#, expect it to be disabled everywhere.
- Avoid writing spaghetti code, keep it human, understandable and easy to follow.
- In the face of ambiguity resist the temptation to guess. Ask questions instead.
- NEVER remove `// ReSharper` comments unless instructed to do so, they function like pragmas specific to JetBrains Resharper and Rider IDE.
- NEVER change the `AGENTS.md` or `copilot-instructions.md` files, UNLESS you're explicitly asked to do so.

Runtime patching:
- For details on patching the game's code using Harmony, see [Patching.md](Patching.md).

Where to get inspiration and existing knowledge from:
- Documentation of the Harmony patching library: https://harmony.pardeike.net/api/index.html
- You can search for Space Engineers plugin projects on GitHub (their source code is public) for inspiration or ideas about how to solve specific issues.
- Be careful with any information before 2019, because the game's code had been changing a lot before that year, making most information older than that unusable.
- The Programmable Block API and Mod API have been pretty stable but slowly changing, including the removal of some features.
- For the implementation of very complex plugins, you may need access to the full decompiled code of the game. You can find a way to decompile the whole game in this repository: https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/se-dotnet-game
- If in doubt, ask for the relevant decompiled game code. ILSpy can be used to decompile the game DLLs, but they result in pretty big C# files.
- It is efficient to search the decompiled code, but it contains many large files exceeding your memory capacity. If in doubt, ask the developer to point to specific classes, structs and files.
- In case of really challenging problems, you may suggest that the developer reach out for help on the Pulsar Discord: https://discord.gg/z8ZczP2YZY

Building the project:
- If you need to build the code, then invoke `dotnet build`.
- Never run verbose builds because they give too much output. Use `Echo` instead print variable values from the build process as/if required.

Also read the project's `README.md` to understand what it is about.
